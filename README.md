# chromiumpages
Chromium error pages. Why? IDK.
You could use it to prank your friends! While they're gone, switch it to the error page and make them think their internet went down. (well, if you do this, make sure to change the URL from example.com to the site they were on, either by downloading it and modifying it or by using inspect element)

URL for index: https://thebombuknow.github.io/chromiumpages/

Just a Repo full of the source HTML for Chromium error pages.
NOTE: The no internet page is missing the dinosaur. I cannot figure out why,  because I can manually decode the image from Base64 and it shows up, but it doesn't show up on the page.

All credit goes to the Chromium Dev Team (obviously)
