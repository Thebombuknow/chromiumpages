Chromium error pages. Why? IDK.
You could use it to prank your friends! While they're gone, switch it to the error page and make them think their internet went down. (well, if you do this, make sure to change the URL from example.com to the site they were on, either by downloading it and modifying it or by using inspect element)

URL for index: https://thebombuknow.github.io/chromiumpages/

Just a Repo full of the source HTML for Chromium error pages.
NOTE: The current one (SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR) is the mobile version.

All credit goes to the Chromium Dev Team (obviously)
